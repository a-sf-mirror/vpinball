DX9 renderer known issues:

*) textboxes don't work
*) text decals don't work
*) kickers cut the ball in half
*) stereo 3D and AO only works on NVIDIA so far (depth buffer read issues)
*) stereo 3D is only working soso since the tweaks to the depth buffer range
*) 4xMSAA flickers, thus disabled
*) textures aren't preloaded, can lead to stutter in some cases
*) adaptive vsync always falls back to normal vsync on XP and is hacky implemented on newer windows versions
*) BG elements abuse the no-vertex-shader pipeline, which doesn't seem to work properly on intel GFX

Not relevant anymore:

*) "real" full screen mode doesn't work with VPM/B2S. Instead, use "Windowed fullscreen" mode.
*) lost devices aren't handled properly (real fullscreen issue only)
