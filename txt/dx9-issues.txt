DX9 renderer known issues:

*) textboxes don't work
*) text decals don't work
*) kickers cut the ball in half
*) stereo 3D and AO only works on NVIDIA so far
*) 4xMSAA flickers, thus disabled
*) textures aren't preloaded, can lead to stutter in some cases
*) adaptive vsync always falls back to normal vsync (can only be supported if we drop XP)

Not relevant anymore:

*) stereo 3D parameters are different
*) "real" full screen mode doesn't work with VPM/B2S. Instead, use "Windowed fullscreen" mode.
*) lost devices aren't handled properly (real fullscreen issue only)
